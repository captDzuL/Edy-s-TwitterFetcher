# Edy-s-TwitterFetcher
Its a sample project for clearing dev task with Mekari

The problem was:

Problem Statement
Edy would like to build an application that can fetch tweets regularly from Twitter and
store those tweets in database. He would like the application to be configurable in which
he can configure the fetch period and has an option to fetch instantly without having to
wait for the fetch period.

I using Java Spring MVC to create this application and mySQL as databases.
I already done 80% of the solution but i cant make the scheduled fetching at this time because lack of time and skills.

Thank you!
